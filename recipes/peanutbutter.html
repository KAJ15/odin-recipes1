        <h1>THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE RECIPE EVER </h1>

        <p>Peanut Butter Cookies, who could resist them? I’ve loved peanut butter cookies as long as I can remember and they’ll always be one of my favorites. So of course it only makes sense that I share my idea of the best peanut butter cookie recipe.</p>

        <p>These easy homemade cookies are soft and chewy, packed with peanut butter flavor, and they’re super delicious dunked in milk!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Baking soda and baking powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar and Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>Creamy Peanut butter</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Baking Directions</h2>

        <li>Preheat oven, prepare baking sheet: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 18 by 13-inch baking sheets with silicone baking liners or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk dry ingredients: In a medium mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cream butter and sugars: In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until combined.</li>
        <li>Mix in peanut butter then blend in egg and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Blend flour mixture into butter mixture: With mixer set on low speed slowly add in flour mixture and mix just until combined.</li>
        <li>Scoop and shape: Scoop dough out and roll into balls (30 grams each or nearly 2 Tbsp) then place on baking sheets spacing them 2-inches apart.</li>
        <li>Flatten with a fork: Using a long pronged fork flatten cookies slightly then turn fork going opposite direction and flatten just slightly again (it should create that criss cross pattern).</li>
        <li>Bake: Bake cookies in preheated oven, one sheet at a time, for about 9 minutes (cookies will appear pale and slightly under-baked, they’ll continue to cook slightly as they cool).
        </li>
        <li>Cool: Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store cookies and an airtight container.</li>
